### What I learned

Coding time: 16,5 hours.

This was really a tough challenge as for intermediate level. I tried to complete it like a month before, but I found to not being ready to code it properly. Even today I left it working almost as should be, but it's definitely not DRY. I used too many if statements (I know I should change it at least to switch) and all my JS code needs a solid refactoring. I know how to tidy there on my own, but I just want to move further. I'm really exhausted by this challenge, lol. There was many DOM manipulations and logic thinking with elements.

Readme says you need a strong undestanding of JS and that's a true. Doing it with vanilla JS approach is a torture :)
